Shell scripting tutorials and questions

## Guidance from the boss:

Great work here!

I’m looking through, I really like how you perform knowledge checks – provide a few statements, then have the candidate answer questions.  I like this method.  Can you also add questions where the student now writes simple scripts to accomplish a task as well.  So for instance Knowledge Check for Expressions on page 3 and 4, after they answer the questions, you ask a few more e.g. how would you program a statement that produces the result of 20 + 15 / 5?  Then build upon that in which you can instruct the candidate to assign variable a to 90, variable b to some other value, etc, then have them create statements to perform various operations. 

In essence, looking at a script and selecting an answer is one thing which is great that you teach.  Then, we really want to evaluate they understand this – and that comes from the ability to produce the correct scripts to answer your questions as well.  Overall, we’re not creating people to be developers… but we do want people to understand how to read scripts and interpret what is going on.  Solid understanding of this is the proven ability to create simple scripts to accomplish tasks. 

Then as you move further in the reading, incorporate concepts from above and build upon all that you are learning.  For instance, when we get to while loops, your knowledge checks are good, then build upon previous content.  You would next have a few loops that incorporate changing more variables, perhaps taking in input from the stdin, manipulating, and providing different output.

I may have missed in in the review, but can you include scripts that take in input from a user, start/stop running processes (if some condition is met), and then also scripts that read/write to another file.  Then, let’s have a few more complex ‘capstone’ scripts that incorporate everything you’ve learned to enable to candidate to truly trace what a script does and its expected output or action.  Then after that, have a few prompts where you tell a user to create a script to accomplish a series of functions: perhaps read a file and write out the file to a new base64 encoded file, and then do the same thing to an encrypted file where the user supplies the encryption/decryption key.  Or you can have the script search for a key or something from an input file, then start a process, or write out sections of a master file into file-fragments based on some condition (e.g. number of lines in a file, or after discovering some delimiter, etc…)

I know email/flat-text messages can lose context, I’ll explain the next time I’m able to make it to the OL.
