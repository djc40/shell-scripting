## Course Outline
01 - Basics


# Basics
## Lesson


First, let's start with an extremely basic script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# A simple script to print a string
MY_STR = "Hello World!"
echo $MY_STR
```
Let's break this down line-by-line:


```#!/bin/bash```: Using the "sha-bang," the #!, this line defines /bin/bash as the interpreter for this script.

```# A simple script to print a string```: Using the "pound" a.k.a. "hash" symbol, this line is a comment. It does not get interpreted and is instead simply a human-readable note.

```MY_STR = "Hello World!"```: MY_STR is a variable. By using "=" we declare and set this variable to be the string "Hello World!"

```echo $MY_STR```: Here we use the bash command 'echo' and by using the dollar sign we refer to our variable. This will print "Hello World!"

## Knowledge Check
Using this script, answer the following questions.

```bash
!#/etc/bash
# This is a script to ***
